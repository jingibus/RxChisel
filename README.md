# RxChisel
A documentation project to shape marble diagrams into real-world examples.

The goal is to roughly mirror the structure of documentation at http://reactivex.io.
For each concept, a concrete, real-world scenario will be shown, as well as how the operator implements it.

This is not intended to be an RxJava cookbook project. Instead, it is meant to supplement the existing marble documentation by showing readable real-world examples for each marble diagram.

## Scope

For now, I am focusing on RxJava, with examples taken from the mobile domain.

Why?
Well, I am an Android developer, and those are the kinds of scenarios I know.
