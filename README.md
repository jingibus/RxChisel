# RxChisel
A documentation project to shape marble diagrams into real-world examples.

The goal is to roughly mirror the structure of documentation at http://reactivex.io.
For each concept, a concrete, real-world scenario will be shown, as well as how the operator implements it.

This is not intended to be an RxJava cookbook project. Instead, it is meant to supplement the existing marble documentation by showing readable real-world examples for each marble diagram.

## Scope

For now, I am focusing on RxJava, with examples taken from the mobile domain.

Why?
Well, I am an Android developer, and those are the kinds of scenarios I know.

## Contributing

If you want to help out, then please bear in mind the following:

1. Please try your best to follow the structure I've followed so far. I will probably provide a fair amount of editorial PR review if a good PR comes up.
2. My writing is not being edited right now. So if you've got the chops to be an editor, I wouldn't turn that down, either.
3. I am currently focused on the writing. If you have other non-writing ways to contribute — e.g. improving the presentation beyond a the current "pile of markdown files" structure — that would be a fantastic way to help out.
